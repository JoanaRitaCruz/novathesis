The project combines both interactive television storytelling and gaming technologies to immerse museum visitors with artefacts on exhibition, engaging the user into physical space using virtual stories.},

	abstract = {The museum landscape has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Technology has made possible new kinds of interactions, visitor expectations have broadened, competition for time and resources has become increasingly intense, and the buildings serve ever-more-complex roles. As a result, interactive designers, including those of us at Second Story, have evolved our skills and approaches to keep pace. This article summarizes many of our observations while sharing some of the best practices that we have evolved to create engaging interactive installations, websites, and experiences. Despite changes in technology and user behavior, a core focus on great storytelling should drive interactive design and serve as the critical element for museums communication and connecting with their visitors.},
