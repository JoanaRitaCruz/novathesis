Technology has made possible new kinds of interactions, visitor expectations have broadened, competition for time and resources has become increasingly intense, and the buildings serve ever-more-complex roles.

This article summarizes many of our observations while sharing some of the best practices that we have evolved to create engaging interactive installations, websites, and experiences. Despite changes in technology and user behavior, a core focus on great storytelling should drive interactive design and serve as the critical element for museums communication and connecting with their visitors.},

Visitor interest in museums is flagging and as audiences’ values shift, so must museums’. While museums have increasingly adopted interactive technologies to engage visitors, these efforts have not yet fully realised museums’ potential in creating immersive and educational experiences that cater to the evolving expectations of modern audiences. This research will investigate how digital technologies can facilitate immersive museum game experiences. By examining the current state of technologically mediated interactive experiences in museums, and museums’ use of games more broadly, a design methodology for museum games can be constructed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new direction for design, in the context of the theme “Next Digital Technologies in Arts and Culture”, by employing modern methods based on Interaction Design, Interactive Storytelling and Artificial Intelligence. Focusing on Cultural Heritage, we propose a new paradigm for Museum Experience Design, facilitating on the one hand traditional visual and multimedia communication and, on the other, a new type of interaction with artefacts, in the form of a Storytelling Experience. Museums are increasingly being transformed into hybrid spaces, where virtual (digital) information coexists with tangible artefacts. In this context, “Next Digital Technologies” play a new role, providing methods to increase cultural accessibility and enhance experience. Not only is the goal to convey stories hidden inside artefacts, as well as items or objects connected to them, but it is also to pave the way for the creation of new ones through an interactive museum experience that continues after the museum visit ends. Social sharing, in particular, can greatly increase the value of dissemination.},

	abstract = {A multimedia approach to the diffusion, communication, and exploitation of Cultural Heritage (CH) is a well-established trend worldwide. Several studies demonstrate that the use of new and combined media enhances how culture is experienced. The benefit is in terms of both number of people who can have access to knowledge and the quality of the diffusion of the knowledge itself. In this regard, CH uses augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality technologies for different purposes, including education, exhibition enhancement, exploration, reconstruction, and virtual museums. These technologies enable user-centred presentation and make cultural heritage digitally accessible, especially when physical access is constrained. A number of surveys of these emerging technologies have been conducted; however, they are either not domain specific or lack a holistic perspective in that they do not cover all the aspects of the technology. A review of these technologies from a cultural heritage perspective is therefore warranted. Accordingly, our article surveys the state-of-the-art in augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality systems as a whole and from a cultural heritage perspective. In addition, we identify specific application areas in digital cultural heritage and make suggestions as to which technology is most appropriate in each case. Finally, the article predicts future research directions for augmented and virtual reality, with a particular focus on interaction interfaces and explores the implications for the cultural heritage domain.},
